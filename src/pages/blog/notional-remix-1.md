### Lowering the water level to see the rocks

I first learnt about this concept from this episode of the North Star podcast:

When trying to refine their production process, Toyota introduced an interesting model which compares inventory levels to the water levels in a river. This idea is now a fundamental part of the [Lean business methodology](https://leankit.com/learn/lean/lean-methodology/). Here’s the idea:

Suppose the goal is to have the safest river for ships to travel through. This means rocks should protrude from the riverbed as little as possible, because rocks may damage the ships. At a high water level, rocks are seldom a problem and thus go unnoticed. But the water level is not always high. In the likely scenario that the water level is low, rocks become a problem. 

In Toyota’s analogy, the water level is the level of inventory, and the rocks are production risks or flaws such as unreliable suppliers. When inventory levels are high, there is some margin to absorb delays from unreliable suppliers, and sales are not disrupted. To refine their process, Toyota decided to slowly lower their inventory levels (or water level) to make their risks and inefficiencies (or rocks) more visible. Only then could they go about improving those areas.

The same concept can be applied to time management. As you reduce the amount of time you allocate to tasks, your inefficiencies in performing these tasks will become more apparent. If you were to cut your workday from 8 hours to 2 hours, it would be far more noticeable when you spend time on something unproductive.

Lower your water level to see your rocks.

### Role-playing death for a new perspective on life

There’s a growing trend in South Korea where people are [role-playing their own funerals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejEaJUEOhjs) to get a better perspective on life.

South Korean students on average spend roughly 16 hours per day on school-related activities. The South Korean work environment is even more competitive. This highly competitive and stressful environment has led to a surge of searching for meaning through simulated death.

Participants write their wills and farewell letters to loved ones. They see their framed portraits alongside candles at coffins. They then lie inside the closed caskets and reflect on the meaning of their life and death. 

It seems that when we are more aware of our mortality, we find greater meaning in life.

As automation continues to displace jobs, unskilled labour markets will become increasingly competitive. This will likely lead to the proliferation of similar meaning-seeking activities.
