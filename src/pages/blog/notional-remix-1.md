### Lowering the water level to see the rocks

I first learnt about this concept from this episode of the North Star podcast:

When trying to refine their car production process, Toyota introduced an interesting model which compares inventory levels to the water levels in a river. This idea is now a fundamental part of the [Lean business methodology](https://leankit.com/learn/lean/lean-methodology/). Here’s the idea:

Suppose your goal is to build the safest river for ships. You inspect the closest natural river. The water is murky, and you wonder if there are any rocks below that might damage your ships. When the water level is high, you can't see any rocks. But that's fine because your ships float well above any rocks – the rocks are not a problem and therefore go unnoticed. But the water level is not always high. As the water level drops, the rocks become more visible and more of a problem. If the water level were to drop quickly, there would not be enough time to remove the rocks and ships would be damaged. A good approach would be to slowly lower the water level, giving you enough time to remove rocks as you discover them.

In Toyota’s analogy, the water level is their level of inventory, and the rocks are production process risks such as unreliable suppliers. When Toyota's inventory levels are high (they have many finished cars available and ready to be sold), a delay in production caused by an unreliable supplier might be ignored – as long as Toyota has cars to sell to eager customers, revenue will continue to pour in, and the supply chain problems go unnoticed, unsolved, and remain a risk.

But what if Toyota's inventory (their water level) is suddenly depleted, perhaps by an earthquake destroying the warehouse? Now, if production stops because of an unreliable supplier (the rock in the river), Toyota may run out of cars to sell, and their eager customers will have no choice but to go to Toyota's competitors. Toyota's revenue drops, managers take notice, and the supply chain problem is suddenly visible.

Toyota's solution was to slowly lower their water levels (such as inventory) intentionally, in order to uncover the problems in their process. As these problems became visible, Toyota could solve them while minimizing the negative financial impact. When all the visible problems were solved, Toyota would once again lower the "water levels", see the "rocks", and remove risk and inefficiency from their process. 

The same concept can be applied to areas in your personal life, like time management. As you reduce the amount of time you allocate to tasks, your inefficiencies in performing these tasks will become more apparent. If you were to cut your workday from 8 hours to 2 hours, you would quickly notice when you're spending time on less important tasks. This would allow you to identify tasks that waste your time, remove them from your daily routine, and become more effective with your time. 

Lower your water level to see your rocks.

### Role-playing death for a new perspective on life

There’s a growing trend in South Korea where people are [role-playing their own funerals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejEaJUEOhjs) to get a better perspective on life.

South Korean students on average spend roughly 16 hours per day on school-related activities. The South Korean work environment is even more competitive. This highly competitive and stressful environment has led to a surge of searching for meaning through simulated death.

Participants write their wills and farewell letters to loved ones. They see their framed portraits alongside candles at coffins. They then lie inside the closed caskets and reflect on the meaning of their life and death. 

It seems that when we are more aware of our mortality, we find greater meaning in life.

As automation continues to displace jobs, unskilled labour markets will become increasingly competitive. This will likely lead to the proliferation of similar meaning-seeking activities.
