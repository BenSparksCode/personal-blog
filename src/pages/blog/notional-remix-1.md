# Choosing Your Ideal Career: An Explore-Exploit Trade-off

A question I’ve been thinking about lately:

> #### “At what point do I stop exploring potential career paths and pick one which best fits me?”

One possible way to approach this question is to see it as an **explore-exploit trade-off**. Let me explain…

There’s a famous problem in Computer Science and Probability Theory called the [multi-armed bandit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit), which basically goes as follows:

You walk into a casino full of slot machines. Each machine has a different probability of paying out a reward if the lever is pulled. You don’t know what these probabilities are. Of course, you want to maximize your winnings. You are now faced with an explore-exploit trade-off. How much time do you spend exploring new machines with the aim of finding one that yields a higher return than your best-known machine so far? Time spent on that search has an opportunity cost – it is time not spent playing the highest yield machine of the machines you’ve already tried.

The career choice problem is similar to the multi-armed bandit problem in many ways. We want to maximize something, in this case career fulfilment. We have limited career time and two ways to spend that time: explore alternative career paths for something more fulfilling or enjoy the most fulfilling career path discovered so far. Herein lies the trade-off. 

One simplistic approach is to apply the **37% rule**: spend 37% of your total career time exploring your options. After that, choose the “best” career for you from what you’ve explored so far.

It turns out that this is often the optimal strategy in explore-exploit problems. If you’re wondering why that is, here’s the [math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem) behind the 37% rule.

**Side note:** check out [Algorithms to Live By](https://amzn.to/32vO4KM) if you’re interested in how this strategy applies to other problems in everyday life.

Assume total career time is from when you are 14 years old (entering high school) to when you are 60 years old (a common retirement age). That’s 46 years. 37% of 46 years is about 17 years. That puts the optimal end of the exploration phase at **31 years old**.

In reality, most people only start exploring potential careers for themselves later, often only towards the end of high school. Furthermore, career exploration is often neglected during high school and college, with greater emphasis put on achieving high grades in tests. Lastly, the tradition around career exploration is that it should end after graduating from college – you enter the professional world, pick a career, and seldom stray from that path.

Let’s compare this societal norm to our theoretical optimal solution. Career exploration only starts a couple years after entering high school (16 years old) and stops at the [average graduation age](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=79474) (around 26 years old). Assuming retirement at 60 years old, the current exploration phase is 10 years of a 44-year total career time. So more realistically, of our total career time, we’re spending **only 23% exploring** – significantly lower than the optimal 37%.

#### Key takeaways:
 - Start your exploration phase early.
 - During your exploration phase, **explore widely and rigorously**.
 - Don’t stop exploring prematurely, be open to swapping to new career paths after you start working.
