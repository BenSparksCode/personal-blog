### This is it, my first ever blog post!

And hopefully the first of many. Now, please enjoy some quotes from *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, sorted by length. 

“Don't Panic.”

“So long, and thanks for all the fish.”

“Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”

“We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!”

“The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.”

“If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.”

“For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen.”

“The Answer to the Great Question... Of Life, the Universe and Everything... Is... Forty-two,' said Deep Thought.”
